## Abstract

One of the fundamental challenges in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) is to tune a brain signal decoder to reliably detect a user's intention. While information about the decoder can partially be transferred between subjects or sessions, optimal decoding performance can only be reached with novel data from the current session. Thus, it is preferable to learn from unlabeled data gained from the actual usage of the BCI application instead of conducting a calibration recording prior to BCI usage. We review such unsupervised machine learning methods for BCIs based on event-related potentials of the electroencephalogram. We present results of an online study with twelve healthy participants controlling a visual speller. Online performance is reported for three completely unsupervised learning methods: (1) learning from label proportions, (2) an expectation-maximization approach and (3) MIX, which combines the strengths of the two other methods. After a short ramp-up, we observed that the MIX method not only defeats its two unsupervised competitors but even performs on par with a state-of-the-art regularized linear discriminant analysis trained on the same number of data points and with full label access. With this online study, we deliver the best possible proof in BCI that an unsupervised decoding method can in practice render a supervised method unnecessary. This is possible despite skipping the calibration, without losing much performance and with the prospect of continuous improvement over a session. Thus, our findings pave the way for a transition from supervised to unsupervised learning methods in BCIs based on event-related potentials.

## Methodology

Online study comparing three unsupervised learning methods (EM, LLP, MIX) for P300 speller. Twelve healthy volunteers (8 female, 4 male, mean age 26, range 19-31 years) participated in a single session each. Subjects spelled the German sentence 'Franzy jagt im Taxi quer durch das' (35 characters) in three blocks, each using a different unsupervised algorithm in pseudo-randomized order. Each trial (spelling one character) consisted of 68 highlighting events with 250 ms SOA and 100 ms stimulus duration (ISI=150 ms). The speller used a modified 6x6 grid with 36 normal characters extended with 10 # symbols as visual blanks (total 46 symbols). Two interleaved highlighting sequences were used: S1 highlighted only normal characters, S2 highlighted both normal characters and # symbols, creating different known target-to-non-target ratios to enable learning from label proportions. Highlighting consisted of brightness enhancement, rotation, enlargement and trichromatic grid overlay. Classifiers were randomly initialized at block start and updated after each trial. No labeled data was provided during online session. Participants sat 80 cm from a 24-inch screen. EEG was recorded from 31 passive Ag/AgCl electrodes (EasyCap) placed according to extended 10-20 system, with impedances kept below 20 kOhm. Signals were recorded and amplified by BrainAmp DC at 1 kHz sampling rate using BBCI toolbox in Matlab. Data was bandpass filtered (0.5-8 Hz, 3rd order Chebyshev Type II), downsampled to 100 Hz, epoched to [-200, 700] ms relative to stimulus onset, and baseline corrected using [-200, 0] ms interval. Features were mean amplitudes of six time intervals ([50-120], [121-200], [201-280], [281-380], [381-530], [531-700] ms post-stimulus) per channel. No artifact rejection was applied; participants were instructed to avoid artifacts. Performance metrics: spelling accuracy and AUC for target vs. non-target discrimination. Results showed MIX method achieved ~80% accuracy after ~7 characters (168 seconds, 476 epochs) and performed comparably to supervised regularized LDA trained on same amount of labeled data after 10+ characters. Ethics approval was obtained from University Medical Center Freiburg. Participants were compensated 8 Euros per hour for the ~3 hour session (including EEG setup).
